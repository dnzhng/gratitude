# Gratitude

A proof-of-concept gratitude journal web application viewable [here](https://gratitudejournal.herokuapp.com).

A gratitude journal is a	journal	in	which	an	individual	keeps	a	daily	record	of	things	that	they	are	grateful	for	that	day.	Doing	so	allegedly helps	people	focus	on	the more	positive	aspects	of	their	lives,	and	studies	have	shown	that	individuals	who	are	more	grateful	tend	to	be	happier	overall.
